Approach1.py

This file contains all required imports, helper functions, dataset loading code, and driver to run approach 1. The dataset is loaded using the scVelo library, and does not require a separate upload. DO NOT use this file to run the code, but only for inspection. The provided .ipynb file in Google Colab should be used to run all code.
